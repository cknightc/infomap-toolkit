This toolbox contains an implementation of the Infomap algorithm written in java, which is fully concurrent. Also as a part of the code is a parser which reads and writes Gephi (https://gephi.github.io/) .gexf files.

All credit for the Infomap algorithm goes to Martin Rosvall & Carl Bergstrom. Neither of which are associated with the owner of this repository.
